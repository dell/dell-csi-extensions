# Dell CSI Extensions

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

This repository holds definitions of additional `grpc` protocols which can be implemented by CSI drivers to build upon existing
functionality supported via the Container Storage Interface ([CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)).
These are defined as .proto files, and compiled using the protoc program to generate a go file.

Current set of supported protocols:

* podmon -  Extensions to CSI to enable CSI drivers to report host connectivity status
* replication - Extensions to CSI to enable CSI drivers to leverage storage array based
 replication within Kubernetes clusters

You can utilize the provided `Makefile` to compile protocol definitions in .proto files to go source files and then build
the source files.

* `podmon` to compile and update files for podmon
* `replication` to compile and update files for replication.

Each protocol is available as a `go module` and can be included separately in CSI drivers.

If you are using `gocsi` for developing CSI driver, these extensions APIs can be used in CSI drivers by registering additional grpc servers while creating the `Storage Plugin` object.
This facility is available in the forked version of gocsi [here](https://github.com/dell/gocsi).

For using `podmon`, include "github.com/dell/dell-csi-extensions/podmon" in your go module dependencies.  
For using `replication`, include "github.com/dell/dell-csi-extensions/replication" in your go module dependencies.
